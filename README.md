## Spider the Web!

This python program recursively lists all links starting from a base URL of the target, and repeats the process for each new link not already in the list. Thus, it broadens the attack surface during penetration tests.

<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to change the target URL in the code before running it on a target.

Usage Syntax: ````python3 directory_crawler.py````
